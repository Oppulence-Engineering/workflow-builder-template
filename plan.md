# Oppulence Outreach

## The Problem

Small businesses spend 15-20 hours per week on manual prospecting and outreach. They use 5-7 disconnected tools (LinkedIn, email finders, CRMs, spreadsheets) and still miss opportunities because they can't personalize at scale.

**Result**: Low reply rates (2-3%), wasted time, inconsistent pipeline.

---

## The Solution

Oppulence Outreach is an **AI-powered customer acquisition engine** that finds, enriches, personalizes, and contacts prospects automatically - turning cold leads into booked meetings while you sleep.

---

## How It Works

```
FIND  →  ENRICH  →  PERSONALIZE  →  SEND  →  BOOK
```

1. **Find Leads**: Scrape Google Maps, LinkedIn, directories - or import your own list
2. **Enrich Data**: Auto-find emails, phones, company data, social profiles
3. **AI Personalization**: Generate unique, context-aware messages for each prospect
4. **Multi-Channel Sequences**: Email + LinkedIn + SMS + Phone in coordinated campaigns
5. **Smart Response Handling**: AI detects positive replies, books meetings automatically

**After 1M emails sent, we know:**

- What subject lines work for dentists in Texas
- What time insurance agents check email
- What triggers positive responses
- Which leads are worth pursuing

**This data is unforkable.** Competitors can copy features. They cannot copy 1M data points of what works.

## Sample Outreach to Lead Gen Agencies

```
Subject: Saw you're running lead gen campaigns for {{niche}} clients

Hey {{firstName}},

Noticed {{companyName}} does lead gen for {{niche}} companies.

Quick question - how much time does your team spend on:
1. Finding leads (scraping, list building)
2. Enriching data (finding emails)
3. Writing personalized emails
4. Managing sequences across tools

We built something that automates all 4 steps. One client went from
50 personalized emails/day to 500 - same team size.

Worth a 15-min call to see if it fits?

{{signature}}

P.S. We also scrape Google Maps for local leads -
game-changer for local service clients.
